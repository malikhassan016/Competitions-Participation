# Sasta Ticket Competition
Sasta Ticket Competition is a competition organized by a flight booking company in Pakistan named "SastaTicket". The problem is to accurately predict the flight prices. The data contains 2 Crore rows which requires high computation resources so I used google colab for it. 
I have used multiple supervised machine learning  regression models for flight price prediction and evaluated them based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The evaluation shows that Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models in terms of Accuracy and RMSE.
